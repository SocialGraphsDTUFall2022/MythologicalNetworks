# Mythological Networks

The current repository contains supporting files for the Mythological Networks Project:

the wiki texts of all character pages.
the full directed network as an edge-list.
the full directed network in the pickle format.
code snippets demonstrating how exactly we extracted the data from Wikipedia pages, constructed the network, and attached the attribute 'length of the content' to the nodes.
